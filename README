This is the Perl 5 MegaHAL distribution.  It requires a previous installation
of MegaHAL.  It was created using MegaHAL version 8 release 6, but may work
with earlier versions of MegaHAL.  The latest version of MegaHAL can be
obtained from:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/megahal/

This package required MegaHAL to be compiled as a shared library, which is not
done in the default MegaHAL installation.  MegaHAL can be compiled as a shared
library by running the following command:

    gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libmegahal.so -o libmegahal.so megahal.c

As root, you can then copy the shared libary that was produced in the previous
step into a library directory as follows:

    cp libmegahal.so /usr/local/lib
    chmod 755 /usr/local/lib/libmegahal.so

Note that you may have to run ldconfig as root after copying the shared library
into /usr/local/lib.

After installing the shared library, the Perl package can be compiled and
installed with the following commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Please report any bugs or send any suggestions in the Perl MegaHAL package to
